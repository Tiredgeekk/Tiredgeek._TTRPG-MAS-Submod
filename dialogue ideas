Monika- "Oooo, a forest adventure. Well let's go (Player)
Narrator- (Player) and Monika unpacked after a long car ride to the Forest of Silvermist. They hauled out thier tents, lanterns and foldable table out of the trunk. But Monika had gotten a strage feeling in her. Like they were not supposed to be there. She let (Player) know this.
Monika: (Player), I'm kind of scared. I saw a bear while driving up to the site. I did not want to scare you too, but I cannot keep that from you anymore. I also heard stories about this forest being haunted by ghosts.

"No such thing as Ghosts, my love" Dialogue:
Narrator- (Player) had reassured Monika that her claims of the forest being haunted was just in her imagination. After a time of stares, Monika felt herself relax. She loved, and had full trust in (Player)
Monika: Okay (Player). I trust you...
Narrator- As Monika and (Player) had finished Monika's tent, they both were caught looking at (Player)'s tent- which was only a pile of tarp and poles. (Player) began picking up the poles to set up, before Monika stretched her hand out, taking hold of (Player)'s arm. 
Monika- Wait... its becoming nighttime. And we have done so much already with setting up my tent. You can just sleep in mine. I know we have one-person tents, but I bet if we try, wn cram in one tent.

"Still scared of ghosts..." Dialogue
Narrator- (Player) than teased Monika. Monika did not look too happy, softer that, (Player) reassured her again, kissed her on the cheek, and began to set up the second tent. Monika helped the best she could, pushing past the nerves in her stomach and the noises she could hear coming through the cracks in the trees around. Once all set up, in was time for bed. And so, Monika went to her bed, leaving (Player) alone in the woods, to smoulder the campfire they had built, and get ready for the next day. (Player) then went into the second tent alone, and started to drift to sleep when the piercing sound of Monika's screem woke him up.
Monika: AAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!
Narrator- (Player) jumped out of bed, frantically unzipping his tent to meet the eyes of a black bear. Past the bear's head, (Player) could see Monika had peeked out of her own tent. But the bear was not focussed on her. But on (Player)... or whatever was below him. (Player looked down and saw...
Monika- It...its the bear's cub.
Narrator- Monika said in shaky breaths
